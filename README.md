# ATC_TLSR_Paper_Flasher
C++ CLI tool to flash TLSR Microcontroller based EPD devices.

This tool is a companion to this project - https://github.com/atc1441/ATC_TLSR_Paper .
That describes how to work with a TLSR based Electronic Paper Display, such as the Hanshow Nebular 350R-N.

That project utilises a webserial flashing tool from a browser tab. See https://atc1441.github.io/ATC_TLSR_Paper_UART_Flasher.html .

This project aims to do the same thing from a Linux command line C++ program.
